# CampingGame
A simple game idea that was thought of by people at my school. You play a game deciding who is going to go camping with you. The initial game rule was to choose an item that you are going to take, using the first name of the person playing.

This is an attempt to replicate this game. It was written in Java because that was the programming language I was learning back then in my Computer Science class.

## Running
On Windows I made a batchfile (`run.bat`) that just ran `java`. Probably wouldn't use them now myself.

## Contributing.
If you have any more rule ideas or suggestions, do feel free to submit them as a PR or an issue!
